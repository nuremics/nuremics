# NUREMICS®

**NUREMICS®** is an open-source Python™ framework for developing customizable scientific workflows.

## Foreword

The **NUREMICS®** project is organized into two complementary repositories:

- **`nuremics`**  _(current repository)_: This repository is the core Python library, installable via `pip install`. It provides the foundational components to create modular and extensible software workflows.

- **[`nuremics-apps`](https://github.com/nuremics/nuremics-apps)**: This repository contains examples of end-user applications built using the **NUREMICS®** framework. It is intended to be **forked** by developers to initiate their own `nuremics-apps` project and build custom applications tailored to their specific use cases.

Developers are encouraged to treat `nuremics` as the core engine, and to use `nuremics-apps` as a starting point for developing and maintaining their own scientific software built on top of the **NUREMICS®** framework.
