This Trademark License Agreement (the "Agreement") governs the use of the trademark "NUREMICS" (the "Trademark"). The Trademark is duly registered by the Licensor in France. The NUREMICS trademark is distinct from the NUREMICS software (the "Software"), an open-source library distributed under the BSD-3-Clause License.
